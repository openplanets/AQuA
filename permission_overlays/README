Create SQLite database by running

sqlite3 volumes.db < schema.sql

Run php sax2sql.php name_of_image.xml > output.txt
to ingest file system tree into database

Run php applyPermmissions.php name_of_image.aff
to apply some permissions to files contained in the image

BUGS

sax2sql.php expects folders to have name_type 'd'. If there is a
folder which has name_type '-', then this breaks the algorithm.
