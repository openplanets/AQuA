INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
Install PHP (Windows/Mac/Linux)
http://www.php.net/

Install Perceptual Image Diff (Windows/Mac/Linux) 
http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/

When installing Perceptual Image Diff on Windows you also need FreeImage.dll
http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/
This DLL needs to be copied to your Windows installation folder (eg. c:\Windows)

USING THE WRAPPER
-----------------
The wrapper script can be put in any folder.
In order for it to work you need to configure:
- where the Perceptual Image Diff binary is located: $pdBinary
- where the folder (w/o trailing slash) with images to compare is located: $pdBinaryOptions 

If you want to pass options such as treshold to the Perceptual Image Diff binary these can be set in: $pdBinaryOptions.
Please consult the Perceptual Image Diff binary webpage for full details about options.
PLEASE NOTE: by default the wrapper passes the option '-verbose' to the binary in order for it to work, you don't need to add this option.

Optionally you can turn debugging on by setting '$debug' to 'true'.
This will provide you with some useful messages when things don't work as expected.

There are two test images provided, these can be found in the subfolder 'testimages'.

RUNNING THE WRAPPER
-------------------
php perceptualDiffWrapper.php

OUTPUT OF THE WRAPPER
---------------------
The wrapper outputs only when it finds two identical images. This is being output in CSV format (IMAGES_IDENTICAL,image1,image2,number of different pixels) where 'IMAGES_IDENTICAL' is just an informational flag. Example:
IMAGES_IDENTICAL,image1.jpg,image2.jpg,100
Please note that when two images are found to be identical, these will be reported twice.

You can redirect output to a file by adding '>output.csv' to the wrapper run command, eg. php perceptualDiffWrapper.php >output.csv.
You can also redirect output to STDIN of another application if wanted.

PLEASE NOTICE:
- when you compare 10 files there will 56 comparisons
- fairly large memory footprint on Windows(tm), especially when comparing images greater than 100kB
